# Keyboard Shortcuts

Master these shortcuts to work faster with GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio. All shortcuts work in Visual Studio 2022 (17.8+) and Visual Studio 2026.

## Inline Completions

Control how Copilot suggests and inserts code as you type.

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Accept entire suggestion | `Tab` |
| Reject/Dismiss suggestion | `Esc` |
| Manually trigger completion | `Alt+.` or `Alt+,` |
| Cycle to next completion | `Alt+.` |
| Cycle to previous completion | `Alt+,` |
| Accept word by word | `Ctrl+Right Arrow` |
| Accept line by line | `Ctrl+Down Arrow` |

**Tip:** Use word-by-word acceptance (`Ctrl+Right Arrow`) to cherry-pick only the parts you need from longer suggestions.

## Next Edit Suggestions (NES)

Navigate and accept intelligent edit predictions.

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Navigate to NES suggestion | `Tab` (first press) |
| Accept NES suggestion | `Tab` (second press) |
| Dismiss NES suggestion | `Esc` |

**Note:** NES uses a two-step Tab workflow—first Tab navigates to the suggestion location, second Tab accepts the change.
