## Overview

GitHub Copilot Code Review examines your local code changes before you commit them. It identifies potential performance, security, and logic issues early—helping you maintain a higher quality codebase without waiting for pull request reviews.

## How to Trigger Code Review

### The Sparkle Button

1. Open the **Git Changes** window in Visual Studio (`Ctrl+Shift+G`)
2. Look for the **sparkle comment button** (✨) in the toolbar
3. Click the sparkle button to initiate code review
4. Copilot examines your uncommitted changes and provides inline suggestions directly in your editor

The review analyzes your entire changeset at once, generating comprehensive feedback across all modified files rather than reviewing file-by-file.

## What It Reviews

Code Review examines all changes in your working directory:

- **Uncommitted changes** — Local modifications before they become part of a commit
- **Staged and unstaged files** — All modified files visible in your Git Changes window
- **Your complete changeset** — Reviews everything together for context-aware feedback

## Types of Issues It Catches

### Logic Errors

Catches subtle bugs that traditional methods might miss. For example, using `disable()` when you likely meant `enable()` based on surrounding context and variable naming.

### Security Issues

Identifies potential security vulnerabilities in your code changes. Flags unsafe patterns before they enter the codebase—catching issues like SQL injection risks, hardcoded secrets, or insecure data handling.

### Performance Issues

Detects potential performance bottlenecks and suggests optimizations. Helps you avoid inefficient patterns like unnecessary allocations or expensive operations in loops.

### Code Quality

Provides suggestions to improve overall code quality—from naming conventions to structural improvements. The latest reasoning models make reviews more insightful and precise.

## Applying Suggested Fixes

1. **Review inline comments** — Suggestions appear directly in your editor as inline annotations
2. **Navigate between comments** — Use the up arrow icon in the top right corner of comment boxes to collapse or navigate to other suggestions
3. **Accept or reject** — Evaluate each suggestion for accuracy and relevance
4. **Apply changes** — Modify your code based on Copilot's feedback before committing

> **Important:** Always review AI suggestions for accuracy before applying them. Copilot provides recommendations, but you make the final decision.

### Git Context in Copilot Chat

Copilot Chat supports referencing your commits and changes directly:

- Use `#changes` to reference your uncommitted changes in chat
- Ask Copilot to summarize what you've changed
- Request explanations for specific commits or modifications

This lets you discuss your changes conversationally before committing, getting additional context beyond the automated review.
