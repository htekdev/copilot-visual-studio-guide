Inline completions are the foundation of GitHub Copilot—the AI-powered suggestions that appear as you type. Understanding how they work and mastering the keyboard shortcuts will dramatically accelerate your coding workflow.

## How Ghost Text Works

As you type in the editor, Copilot provides **ghost text suggestions** with colorized syntax highlighting at your cursor location. These suggestions appear as semi-transparent, italicized text showing what Copilot predicts you'll type next.

**The process:**
1. GitHub Copilot's AI analyzes your current context—the file you're editing, open files, and code patterns
2. As you type, it generates relevant suggestions in real time
3. Suggestions appear inline, ready for you to accept or dismiss

**Types of completions:**
- **Line completions** — Completes the current line you're typing
- **Block completions** — Suggests entire code blocks spanning multiple lines
- **Partial completions** — You can accept all or part of any suggestion

### Visual Studio 2026: Syntax-Highlighted Completions

Visual Studio 2026 introduced **colorized syntax highlighting** for completions. Variables, functions, keywords, and strings each display in distinct colors matching your theme—making suggestions much easier to parse at a glance.

To differentiate suggestions from actual code, completions use **lower opacity** and **italic styling**.

**To enable/disable colorization:**
- Navigate to **Tools → Options → Text Editor → Code Completions**
- Check or uncheck **Use colorized text for code completions**

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Master these shortcuts to work efficiently with Copilot suggestions:

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| **Accept suggestion** | `Tab` |
| **Dismiss suggestion** | `Esc` |
| **Trigger completion manually** | `Alt+.` or `Alt+,` |
| **Cycle to next completion** | `Alt+.` |
| **Cycle to previous completion** | `Alt+,` |
| **Accept word by word** | `Ctrl+Right Arrow` |
| **Accept line by line** | `Ctrl+Down Arrow` |

### Click-to-Accept

Visual Studio also supports **click-to-accept** for partial completions:
1. When a suggestion appears, hover over it
2. As you move the pointer, Visual Studio highlights the segment that will be accepted
3. Click at the point where you want to stop accepting text

This provides a mouse-based alternative for fine-grained control over what you accept.

## Configuration Options

All inline suggestions settings are found via **Tools → Options → Text Editor → Inline Suggestions**.

### Disable Automatic Completions

By default, every keystroke triggers suggestions. To switch to manual mode:

1. Navigate to **Tools → Options → All Settings → Text Editor → Inline Suggestions → General**
2. Set **Inline Suggestions Invocation** to **Manual**
3. Trigger suggestions manually with `Alt+,` or `Alt+.`

This is useful if you find automatic suggestions distracting during initial coding.

### Adjust Completion Timing

If completions appear too quickly and interrupt your flow:

1. Navigate to **Tools → Options → All Settings → Text Editor → Inline Suggestions → Preferences**
2. Enable **Show inline suggestions only after a pause in typing**

This adds a debounce delay so completions don't flash and disappear while you're actively typing.

### Change Accept Shortcut

The default `Tab` key can be changed to `Right Arrow` if you prefer:
- Find this option in the Inline Suggestions preferences

### Customize Appearance

Fine-tune how completions look via **Tools → Options → Environment → Font and Colors → Code Completions**:
- Font type and size
- Foreground/background color
- Style (italic, etc.)
- Opacity level

## Comment-First Development

One of the most powerful patterns for getting great completions is **comment-first development**—describe what you want in a comment, then let Copilot generate the implementation.

### How It Works

1. Write a natural language comment describing the desired functionality
2. Press `Enter` to move to the next line
3. Copilot generates code matching your description
4. Accept with `Tab` or cycle through alternatives with `Alt+.`

### Example

```csharp
// method to add two numbers
```

After pressing Enter, Copilot suggests:

```csharp
public int AddNumbers(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}
```

### Best Practices for Comments

- **Be specific** — "Validate email format using regex" beats "Check email"
- **Describe intent** — Focus on *what* not *how*
- **Use domain language** — Match the terminology in your codebase
- **Break down complex tasks** — Multiple smaller comments work better than one giant one

### Use Cases

Comment-first development excels at:
- **Converting requirements to code** — Describe functionality, get implementation
- **Creating unit tests** — Describe test scenarios in comments
- **Generating SQL queries** — Describe the data you need
- **Building boilerplate** — Describe patterns and structures

## Tips for Best Results

**Write clear context:** Copilot analyzes your current file and open tabs. Keep relevant files open and use descriptive variable and function names.

**Iterate with alternatives:** If the first suggestion isn't right, press `Alt+.` to cycle through alternatives before writing manually.

**Use partial acceptance:** Accept suggestions word-by-word (`Ctrl+Right Arrow`) or line-by-line (`Ctrl+Down Arrow`) when only part of a suggestion is useful.

**Trust but verify:** Copilot generates statistically likely code, not guaranteed correct code. Review suggestions before accepting, especially for security-sensitive or complex logic.

**Leverage existing code patterns:** Copilot learns from your codebase. Consistent patterns in your code lead to more accurate suggestions.

## Code Referencing

If you or your organization enable suggestions matching public code, Copilot notifies you when a completion matches code from a public GitHub repository.

To view details:
- Select **View code matches** in the notification
- Check the GitHub Copilot logs in the **Output** window
- The log entry includes a link to GitHub.com with license information

This enables informed decisions about code attribution.

## Prerequisites

To use inline completions:
1. **Visual Studio 2026** or **Visual Studio 2022 version 17.14+**
2. **GitHub account** signed in to Visual Studio with Copilot access
3. **Copilot subscription** or the **Copilot Free plan** (monthly limits apply)
