Press **Ctrl+\+C** to open the Chat window. Ask questions like:
- "How do I read a file in C#?"

### 3. Check the Status Badge

The Copilot badge in the upper-right corner shows your connection status:
- **Green (Active):** Copilot is ready
- **Inactive:** Sign-in or subscription issue
- **Unavailable:** Network or server problem

### 4. Configure Settings

Click the **Copilot badge** → **Settings** to configure:
- Enable/disable completions
- Block suggestions matching public code (via [github.com/settings/copilot](https://github.com/settings/copilot))
